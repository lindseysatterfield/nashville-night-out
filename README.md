# &#10024; Nashville Night Out &#10024;

#### Overview
Nashville Night Out is an app where authenticated users can log Nashville restaurants to help them keep track of where they would like to eat. Once authenticated, users will have the option to add their own restaurants along with the name, image URL, short description, website URL, reservation URL, cuisine type, and neighborhood of that restaurant. There will also be an option to check if they have visited or if it is a favorite. With the Let's Eat feature, clicking a button will give the user a random restaurant from their list.

#### Motivation
Nashville is quickly becoming a foodie town. As someone who likes to visit new restaurants, I have a hard time choosing which one to try out as there are so many to choose from. With the help of this app, I have a way to log them to keep track of where I have and haven't been. With the Let's Eat randomizer feature, I now have the option to never ask "Where should we eat tonight?" ever again as a restauruant will be chosen for me.
