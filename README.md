# Nashville Night Out

#### Overview
Nashville Night Out is an app where authenticated users can click a button to then receive a random restaurant in Nashville. The town has so many restaurants to choose from and this will help users from having to ask, "Where should we eat tonight?" The restaurant card will include restaurant name, image, link to their website, link to a reservation site, description, type of cuisine, and location area. The user will also have an option to add/update/delete a restaurant and favorite a restaurant. There will be restaurants that are in view as 'public restaurants' that the user cannot delete/update. When the user favorites a restaurant, it will be on their favorites view. On the favorited restaurant card, users will have the to option to add if they have visited or not. They will also have an option to add what looks good to them on the menu. A 'view all restaurants' view will also be avaliable for the user to see both public restaurants and their added restaurants.
