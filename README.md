# 	&#10024; Nashville Night Out &#10024;

#### Overview
Nashville Night Out is an app where authenticated users can click a button to then receive a random restaurant in Nashville. The town has so many restaurants to choose from and this will help users from having to ask, "Where should we eat tonight?" The restaurant card will include restaurant name, image, link to their website, link to a reservation site, description, type of cuisine, and location area. The user will also have an option to add/update/delete a restaurant and favorite a restaurant. There will be restaurants that are in view as 'public restaurants' that the user cannot delete/update. When the user favorites a restaurant, it will be on their favorites view. A 'view all restaurants' view will also be available for the user to see both public restaurants and their added restaurants.

#### Motivation
Nashville is quickly becoming a foodie town. As someone who likes to visit new restaurants, I have a hard time choosing which one to try out as there are so many to choose from. With the help of this app, all the hard work of picking a restaurant will be done for me as a different one will be sent to me with only the click of a button.
